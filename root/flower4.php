	<br>
	<h3>Weather</h3>
	<p>Wet weather and average temperature of 20 to 30 dregee centegrade cm for proper growth. Need to be Suitable time to produce adequate sunlight and coastal areas and rainy season. In winter the production of pulmonary flower flowers decreases. But semi-double and double varieties have been used to give flowers even during winter.</p>
		<h3>Land Selection:</h3>
	     Frozen soil rich fennel soil. High and medium high ground, soil with the ability to extract water. Shadowless and communication system is good. Land that has water irrigation system and land pH 6.5 to 7.5.
     <h3>The time of Plantation</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Rabi season: From mid-air to the end of the Kartik (October to mid-November).</li>
       <li> Kharif season: From 1st Chaitra to Boishakh (from mid-March to early April).</li>
	   </ul>
		
		<h3>Planting Method:</h3><p>
		When the land is finished, the 5-feet-wide bed will be made. Bulb should be planted after 7 to 10 days after making the bed. A bulb from 0.6 to 1.18 inches will be required. The distance from row to row is 12 inches and the distance from the bulb to the 8-inch distance. The bulb should be 6 inches deep. Before planting the bulb, the tubers should be kept in the water soluble for about 30 minutes to 4 percent of the urea water to spend the dormancy of the ear (which is not suitable for the period of time).</p>
		
		<h3>Land Preparation and Fertilizer applied Technique</h3>
		 <p>With the first cultivation, 3 tonnes of manure or farm fertilizer should be mixed in every bigha land and 4-5 times deeply irrigated by cultivation and land should be sprayed and equalized. Prior to last cultivation, 14.28-28 urea, TSP, MP fertilizer will be added to the soil as the main fertilizer. Clay gives 10% fertilizer less on the ground. After 2 months, apply to 7 kg urea after every 2 months. The land work will be completed at least 15 days before planting. To cultivate the tub, fill the tub with 2 parts of soil, 1 part of the rotten fertilizer, and 1 part dung tofu. Two tubes can be fitted in a tub.</p>
		<h3>Care at the time of farming</h3>
		<p>
	<ul>	
<li>Irrigation and drainage: There should always be juice on the soil of the tuber's soil. It should be irrigated after 7 days in summer and after 10 days in winter.</li><li>

<h5>Management:</h5><p>To destroy the infected plants will be destroyed. The soil should be wet with the mixture of 4 grams of Kupravit / Benzim / Bavistin / Sevin mixed in the starting soil of the plant every liter of water. In diseased tree, apply for 2 to 3 times per liter of water, after mixing it with 4 grams of Kupravit / Benzim / Bavistin / Seven.</p>

<br/>

<h3>Root knot disease:</h3><p>
		The roots of the wormwood form the cocoon. The roots of the affected plants become like a flower tie. As a result, eating and drinking water from the soil of the trees is hampered. Tree does not grow easily, flowers do not grow. At the end of the tree becomes weak and the plants die.</p>
		<h5>Management:</h5><p>
In the same land, it is better to not cultivate resinjagna and brinjal clusters in two to three years in a row. If one of the two species of rhizoma plant is planted in a rhinoceros tree, then mixed with rhizoma mixed with rhizoma will reduce the lethality of worms. Nim khail can be sprayed on the land. During the planting of the bulb, the needle and the newfaron sprinkle with soil to the soil of the rows should be mixed with soil. Then there is a lot of attack on the disease when planting the bulb there. If initially few trees have been planted, then those trees should be removed or removed from the land. The soil of the infected site will be used to make a hole in the hole and burn the straw.</p>
<h3>Flower Collecting</h3><p>
During the 70 to 90 days of tubing, the sticks came to the tree. The sharp knife should be used during the stick cutting. The first flower of the juice of the juice of the tuberose will be cut with flowers. The flowers will be cut in the cold weather or early afternoon. When cutting the stick, be careful that it is 1.5 to 2.5 inches above the soil. As soon as the cutting is done, the bottom portion of the sticks should be kept in the shade of water, so that the floral and refreshing taste is maintained.</p>
<h3>Harvesting</h3>

The fruits are collected in 90-110 days.

<h3>Bulb lift and preservation
</h3>
<p>
The pulp of tuberose can be easily lifted and stored. When the growth of the plant is stopped in December-January, the bulb should be removed from the soil and spread out in a clean, shaded dry floor. Mature tubers are later used as seeds.
</p>
<h3>Processing:</h3>
<p>Flowers and leaves can dry out after flowering and leaf leaves emerge. For this reason, unnecessary pages will be cut off. After that the bundle is prepared by wrapping the sticks on the wet newsprint paper and then holding it in black polythene, the body should be kept in the cold water for about 4 hours.
