	The flowers are holy. Flowers are symbols of whiteness, beauty and peace. There is always the attraction of people towards flowers. In many parts of the world, flowers are cultivated commercially as a cash crop, which has turned flowers into art. Our country's soil and weather are very useful for flowering.<br> In Bangladesh, love for flowers is increasing day by day. Floral necklaces, flower bouquets are used on different national days, including birthdays, weddings, religious ceremonies. Countries like India, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam, Japan, etc., have the opportunity to participate in a significant trade of 20 billion dollars in the current world market.<br> To involve Bangladesh in flower cultivation of the world market, it is necessary to look at commercially producing flowers. If the vast rural population of our country comes forward in the field of flower farming and can increase commercially, then it can be economically profitable.<br>
      Depending on their situation and resources, cut flower growers use a variety of 'store bought' and 'make-your-own' tools, equipment, and structures to produce their crops.</br>
	  Bill Harlan at Belvedere Farm in Harford County uses this 
      board system to get the glass mason jars safely to market.
	  <br>At the Weaverâ€™s Farm, they use fiberglass stakes to
support their cut flower netting. The ones shown here
are U-shaped which provide better support, but are also
more expensive than the L-shaped stakes.

	  More growers like Dave Dowling, Farmhouse Flowers and 
Plants (out of business), are producing some crops in high 
tunnels in order to start production earlier in the spring and 
extend the season later in the fall.</p>
