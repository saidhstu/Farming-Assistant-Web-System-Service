	<h3>Conservation of domestic fish and cultivation</h3>
	<p>In the words we have got to eat fish in Bengali. However, in our Havelipana, there are lost places like Shol, Gajar, Vetki, Pabda, Taki, Bauamach, Tapi, Gulsha, Kachki, Khaysha, Kai, Chital, Boal, Tengra, Aid, Bain, Puti, Shing, Poli and Magu. But it is important to save our local fish. Besides, due to the absence of transport conservation, the amount of fish produced in the river-stream, canal bill hawr and the ocean is destroyed. After fishing, 30 percent of the fish are wasted before they reach the customer. The amount of loss is about 6 thousand crore rupees annually.</p>
		<h3>Domestic Fish preserve practicable
        </h3>
		
		<p>The first thing we need to take some practical steps. They are: to follow the Fisheries Act, stop the use of the carnage, to ensure the socio-economic security of the family, to create fish self-employment in the country, to rectify the needs of the old ponds, to preserve the natural fertility of small fish and to keep the internal free water reservoir, prevent the flooding of the floodplains, majudakarana production and land inundation, social awareness, through the small community management Acha farming and the conservation and preservation of the juvenile fish.
        </p>
		<h3>Important things to do in preserving local fish:</h3>
		<p>
		First of all, we should think about natural water bodies, floodplains, jatka fish conservation and fisheries environment-friendly policies and infrastructure. Because 12 of the 260 endangered and 28 inconvenienced people in the internal free water body of Bangladesh Although we have 296 fish of fishery and 511 marine fish, including shrimp. After analyzing these issues, natural water bodies, free water bodies and floodplains have been threatened due to our unethical use due to natural reproduction and reproduction of fish. Government, non-government organizations and the Department of Fisheries are very much promoting the promotion of fish jatka, but that has not yet turned into a social movement. Jatka fish must be protected and flown freely in the open floodplain. In order to prevent flood control or unplanned mud roads in polders and village level, so that the movement of fish, breeding can not be hampered. And our social movement needs to be done. In that case, we will never use poison, rotenon and other chemicals in the field of fishing. Rather it is possible to change the country's socio-economic face by preserving and saving the local fish. That is why successful implementation of the fisheries environment policy and infrastructures.

		<h3>Conservation and cultivation of domestic fish, our profits:</h3>
		<p>In the words - Fish Fona, Country of Gold. And domestic fish is a very good source of nutrients. These fishes are rich in minerals such as calcium, phosphorus, iron and iodine, and vitamins. Besides, the local fish have blindness, anemia, and pelvic resistance. Especially pregnant mothers and children need to eat small fish. These nutrients of the local fish are unmatched for the safety of the skin. That is why we have many profits in saving and cultivating local fish.</p>
		
		<h3>How can we save local fish through fish farming:</h3>
		<p> The local fish must be brought under the scientific method. We can adopt a number of strategies to find more native species of fish in closed water. They are: Providing small fish farming in rice fields and making pond for pond in the rice field for this year; In fish breeding seasons, not to use leaked mesh, toxic poisoning to reduce gigantic fish, to create a social movement for cultivation of small fish species with Rui National fish, pond floodplain and pond for native fish.</p>
		
<h3>Social movement to cultivate native fish</h3>


		<p> Presently the natural breeding ground of the fish, movement is in great danger. We do not know, we do not understand the jatka. Moreover, many local fish are no longer known due to excessive use of pesticides, unplanned dams, and pest and egg-feeding fish, and no fertility of fish in breeding season. But if we all know and become aware of these things, then we would get the taste and nutrition of the country's fish all year round. Everyone's sincerity needs to be released from this unexpected situation. And this is the social movement.</p>
