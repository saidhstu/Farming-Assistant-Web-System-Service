	<h3>Uses</h3>
	<p>Used for making grease and soap for machinery.</p>
		<h3>Suitable land and soil</h3>
		
		<p>Clay soil is most suitable for cultivation of linseed. It is also cultivated in poly-foam and clay fennel soil. 
        </p>
		<h3>Identity of the species:</h3>
		<p>The species was selected through the selection process and was approved by the National Seed Board in 1988. The characteristics of the species are: seeds small and flattened. Fruit 1000 seeds weighing 3.0-3.5g. Flower color blue Holding the seeds was felt slippery. Seasonal oil removes 38 percent Hectare yields 850-950 kg</p>
		<h3>The time of Bunner</h3>
		<p>
		From October to mid-October seed sowing is sprinkled, but if the row is sown, the distance from row to row will be 30 cm.
		</p>
		<h3>Sowing method and seed rate</h3>
		<p>ISunflower seeds are sown in rows. Rows range from 50 cm in length and 25 cm from tree to tree. Thus, weighing 8-10 kgs of seeds per hectare (247th century) takes place. For bari sun-2-2, we need 12-15 kg of seeds per hectare.</p>
		
		<h3>Fertilizer applied Technique</h3>
		<p> Generally sesame seeds are cultivated without fertilizer. But to get good yields, fertilizers should be applied at the rate below.
Fertilizer<br>
Amount of fertilizer per hectare (kg)
<br>
Urea
70-80
<br>
TSP
110-130
<br>
Mop
40-50
<br>
Urea fertilizer half and the rest of the other fertilizers will be mixed in the field during the last cultivation. Apply the remaining half urea seeds after 25-30 days after sowing..</p>
		<h3>Insects Management</h3>
		<p>
This disease spreads with the help of a type of fungus called Alternatoria linni. This is a seed born disease. At first, there is an uneven stain of dark brown color on the leaves. If the disease progresses, the leaves dry up. The disease spread with the help of air.
		
<h3>Management:</h3>
Before seed sowing, seeds will be treated with 2.5 gram Vitavax-200 per kg seed. Reduce the prevalence of disease by including weed control and crop care. When symptoms of this disease appear on the tree, mixing 2 grams of Rowral -50 WP per liter of water should be sprayed 3 times in 10 days.
