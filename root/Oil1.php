		<h3>Suitable land and soil</h3>
		
		<p>Frozen, fuzzy, dirty-clay and clay-soaked soil is suitable for soybean cultivation.
        </p>
		<h3>The time of Bunner</h3>
		<p>
	Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute has developed three varieties of soybean. The characteristics of the species are mentioned below.
	Soybean is cultivated in both rabi and kharif season in Bangladesh. But it is better to sow the pas month (mid-December to mid-January). On the other hand, during the monsoon season Sravan month to mid-Bhadra can be sown.
		</p>
		<h3>Sowing method and seed rate</h3>
		<p>Soybean rows are good to sow. But it can be sprayed. Rows from row to row after sowing in the row 30 cm in rabi season And in the Kharif season 40 cm have to give. The distance from the tree to the tree is 5-6 cm. Seed sowing depth will be 3-4 cm.</p>
		
		<h3>Fertilizer applied Technique</h3>
		<p> Half of urea and all other fertilizers will be mixed with soil sprouting in the field during the last cultivation. The remaining half of the urea should be applied 20-25 days after the first part of the seedling and the second part 40-45 days (before flowering).</p>
		<h3>Insects Management</h3>
		<p>
Soybean is a deadly insect. In short they are grouped. The worm is yellow in color and the thorn in the neck. They usually attack on the leaves of trees. The worm carries the leaf from the green part of the leaves and forms the thin white screen.
		
<h3>Management:</h3>
After seeing the worm, the leaves will be collected from insects by planting insects and killing insects. If there is water mixed with kerosene in the irrigation drain, the worms die in the water. The water will be mixed in the afternoon by mixing it with diagenine-60 EC 2 ml per liter of water.

<h3>Name of the disease:</h3><p>Leaf blight disease</p>

<br />

		<h3>Damage Samples:</h3>
		<p> The green sheet of soybean appears on the top of the plate to reveal the bright golden or yellow curly spots. Yellow-leafy trees are usually shorter and nimble. This disease increases due to cloudy weather. Expansion through jab poker.</p>
<h3>Irrigation and weed management</h3>
<p>In the Rabi season, within 25-30 days of planting (during flowering). The first irrigation and second irrigation seed should be given in 55-60 days (during formation of the shital). Kharif season does not require irrigation, but supplementary irrigation can be provided if necessary. After 20 to 25 days of weeding, weed should be suppressed.</h3>
<p>Squirrels are harmful to the orange due to the raw and ripe and potato ripe. They make more damage at night. Ornaments can be kept by hanging in tin or brass box or by hanging in a garden with kakarwariya / kakarwari.</p>
<h3>Harvesting</h3>
<p>
It takes 90-120 days for soybean seed to be harvested. When the crop is mature, the tree with yellow gram comes in yellow and the leaves begin to fall. At the time, harvesting of trees is necessary to collect crops.
