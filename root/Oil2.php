	<h3>Nutrition and Herbal Compounds</h3>
	<p>
	Sunflower seeds contain 40-45% linoleic acid, and there is no harmful erocic acid in the plant. Sunflower oil is very beneficial for heart patients.
	</p>
	<br>
	<h3>Uses</h3>
	<p>The cough of Sunflowers is used as a food for cows and buffaloes. After leaving the seeds, heads can be used as a cow's food. Trees and floral plants are used as fuel.</p>
		<h3>Suitable land and soil</h3>
		
		<p>Surja Mukhi is usually born on the ground. However, furrow soil is the most useful.
Introduction of the species: So far two varieties have been invented by Bari. Namely (1) Kirani (DS-1) and Bari Suraksha-II. 
        </p>
		<h3>The time of Bunner</h3>
		<p>
		Sunflower can be cultivated throughout the year. However, if the cultivation months are harvested, good yield is available. If the temperature is below 15 cents in the north and west regions of the country, the seed should be sown 10-12 days later. It can be cultivated in the Kharif-1 season in the month (mid-April to mid-May).
		</p>
		<h3>Sowing method and seed rate</h3>
		<p>ISunflower seeds are sown in rows. Rows range from 50 cm in length and 25 cm from tree to tree. Thus, weighing 8-10 kgs of seeds per hectare (247th century) takes place. For bari sun-2-2, we need 12-15 kg of seeds per hectare.</p>
		
		<h3>Fertilizer applied Technique</h3>
		<p> Half of urea and all other fertilizers will be mixed with soil sprouting in the field during the last cultivation. The remaining half of the urea should be applied 20-25 days after the first part of the seedling and the second part 40-45 days (before flowering).</p>
		<h3>Insects Management</h3>
		<p>
They are grouped in small spaces in a small insect. The worm is yellow in color and the thorn in the neck. They usually attack on the leaves of trees. The worm carries the leaf from the green part of the leaves and forms the thin white screen.
		
<h3>Management:</h3>
As soon as the insect is seen, the leaves will be collected from the trees and the insects will be killed. If there is water mixed with kerosene in the irrigation drain, the worms die in the water. If the attack is high, then Nitrogen (Saupermathrin + chloropyripe) 20 EC 2 liters of water per liter of water can be sprayed twice after 10 days.

<h3>Name of the disease:</h3><p>Leaf blight disease</p>

<br />

		<h3>Damage Samples:</h3>
		<p> This disease spreads through alteraniyelionthi fungus. At the beginning of the attack, the leaves are markedly gray or dark brown. These spots combined together cause bigger spots and eventually the whole leaf blazes. With the help of seeds and winds, they get rich.</p>
<h3>Irrigation and weed management</h3>
<p>Sometimes the irrigation plant should be irrigated. In the rainy season, water treatment should be taken so that the water does not accumulate in the beginning of the tree. Besides, weeding of orange plants should be curtailed.</p>
<h3>Squirrel and Badu's attack</h3>
<p>Squirrels are harmful to the orange due to the raw and ripe and potato ripe. They make more damage at night. Ornaments can be kept by hanging in tin or brass box or by hanging in a garden with kakarwariya / kakarwari.</p>
<h3>Harvesting</h3>
<p>
The fruits are collected in 90-110 days.
</p>
<h3>Seed preservation
</h3>
<p>The seeds of sunflower seeds have to be stored in the next season to save. Before the seed is preserved, the seeds of immature and broken seeds should be selected. It is better to store seeds in thick polythene or in kerosene tin or tin drum. Inserting 250 grams of calcium chloride for 30 kg of well-dried seeds in polythene with polythene, and after 7-8 months, 80 percent of the seed capacity of germination continues. It is better to dry the seeds once or twice a year in the rainy season.</p>
