	Brinjal is rich in nutrients, more fiber and profitable. Apart from eating curry in our country, it is eaten as fried, cooked / burnt, and filled with lentils. Eggplants are very popular.</p>
	<h3>Nutration Values</h3>
	<p>
	Almost all of our daily needs are found in Nutritious Brinjal.
	</p>
	<br>
	<h3>Soil</h3>
	<p>Eg-plant is cultivated from light sulphate, ie, almost all types of soil. It is suitable for cultivating brinjal and poly-fiber soil, and this egg is more suitable for eggplants.</p>
		<h3>Kinds of Brinjal</h3>
	     In Bangladesh, the three types of tall fruit, gourmet fruit and round type of eggplants are high. All varieties can be divided into seasonal ways, such as winter brinjal and baramel brinjal. Winter varieties of brinjal are cultivated in Rabi season because the varieties of eggplant can only produce fruit in the rabi season. And baramasi brinjal can be cultivated at any time of the year. Some of the significant varieties of eggplant are: Islpuri, Khatkhita, Lafafa, Ishidi-1, Uttara (Bari brinjal 1), Tal Begun, Nayan Kajol, KG, Brinjuna, Shinatha, Jhumko, Tarapuri (Bari Barguna 2), Kajla (Bari Barguna 4) Nayantara (Bari brinjal 5), Shock F1, Kajal F1 etc. Recently, four varieties of Bt brinjal 1, 2, 3, 4 varieties have been invented from the Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute, which are resistant to the pests of pests that are dangerously harmful to the eggplants.
		
		<h3>Cultivation season:</h3><p>
		In the climate of Bangladesh, eggplant can be cultivated at any time of the year. However, if the cultivation of brinjal in the Rabi season, the yield is available from the Kharif season. For the Rabi season, that is the time for the winter season, usually from August to October. Proper time to harvest seeds from January to May for the Kharif Season, which means rainy seasonal eggplant. Any varieties of eggplant can be planted for Rabi season, but for the Kharif season, pomegranate varieties have to be planted..</p>
		
		<h3>Seed and seed treatment</h3>
		 <p>If you cultivate the brinjal by applying the seeds, many diseases are protected from it. For every kg of seeds, pour 2.5 grams of Vitavax-2 fungus and seed pots should be sprayed in such a way that the fungus destroys the seeds properly. After cleansing the seeds out of the pot, the shade must be dry. Six weeks before seed sowing, it is better to seed.</p>
		<h3>Seedlings Prepare</h3>
		<p>
	For the cultivation of brinjal, it is necessary to plant it on the seedbed and plant it in the original soil. The seed bed should be built in places where rain water does not stand, that should be sunlight, it always has light and air, that means it will be shadowless.
After the cultivation, the entire land will be divided into few small seed beds. Each seed bed should be 3-5 cubic meters in length, one meter in width and 15 centimeters empty space from the side. In addition, two seed beds should be kept free of 50-60 centimeters. Take the soil from the empty space to the seed bed. Wooden boxes, plastic trays or large tub can be used as seedbed for the production of small quantities of seedlings.
For the cultivation of brinjal on every hectare land, 250-300 gms of seeds are needed.
<br>
Seeds can be sifted or sown in the seed bed. Rows from row to row 5 cm in row have to give. After seeding seed, the seed bed will be lightly pressed. The distance of the seedlings in seedling is 2-3 cm. If the growth of the planting is good. After planting seeds, it is necessary to sprinkle water with irrigation by diluting it with water. If needed, the seed bed can be covered with dry straw or polythene sheet or sack. In the summer and in the evening it is necessary to irrigate lightly. After planting, light irrigation should be given in 2-3 days.
		</p>
<h3>Preparing land and Planting Plant:</h3>
<p>
Generally, the land should be sprayed 4-5 times for cultivation of land. 35-45 days old seedling is suitable for planting. At this time, 5-6 leaves grow and the plantation is about 15 cm. Is taller. During sowing, so that the root does not get damaged, we need to soak the soil with water after sowing 1 to 2 hours before sowing. Normally 90 cm in the case of big egg brinjal Row 60 cm in the row Spacing can be planted in spacing and in the case of small varieties 75 cm Rows 50 cm in queue Can be sown in spacing. If possible, then it should be sown in the afternoon if it is possible for the seedlings to not dry up after planting..</p>

<h5>Fertilizer application:</h5><p>By checking the soil, it is better to fertilize according to the demand of land and crop. However, the amount of fertilizer in the ordinary eggplant area is as follows:</p>

<br/>

<h3>Apply Irregation</h3><p>
		Irrigation for the cultivation of brinjal is very important due to the fact that the roots of the eggplants do not go deeper in the soil, so irrigation should be done for better production.</p>
		<h5>Insect management:</h5><p>
The most harmful insect of eggplant is the eggplant and fruit pests. In some areas the main enemy of the little red spider is the enemy. Besides, worms are worn by wormwood or epilacana beetles, jab insects, chhata bees, bite insects, leaf wrapping insects, thrips, katui insects etc.. In order to control these insects in the IPM system, we have to take control.</p>
<h3>Brinjal stripe and barking insect</h3><p>
The insect buds, the leaves of the leaves, the halves, the halves, etc., enter the food to eat. Due to continuous eating, the tunnel is created due to continuous eating. As a result, a tiny stick fell down and eventually died. Likewise, by hitting the fruit, it enters inside and eats the shells. Infected fruits can be seen in the pores of the worm. Infected eggplant cut the stool and rotten tunnel. The worm can be seen. If more infected, the fruit becomes inefficient and there is no demand for bronze in the market.</p>
<h3>Weed Suppression</h3>

Weeds compete with crops for food, water and lighting and as a shelter for insects and diseases. For that, if weeds in the field, sometimes the soil will be cleaned loose. Lightening of the soil can be hired after a certain day after lengthening and it will be better to increase the roots of the tree.

<h3>Fruit collection and harvest</h3>

<p>
The fruit must be collected before it becomes fully mature. If the fruit is good in comparison to the crop, the fruit is good, but the yield is less. From the increase of fruit to adulthood, it is suitable for eating brinjal. Normally it takes around 1 month to get fruit after flowering. It yields 17-64 tonnes per hectare.
