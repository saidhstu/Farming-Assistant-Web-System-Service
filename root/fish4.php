	Lobster shrimp is known in the fast growing shrimp of fresh water in other countries of the world including Bangladesh. Lobster shrubs are found in freshwater and fresh saline water in the natural environment. However, they prefer to stay in the higher part of the river where the tide is different. The lobsters are found in natural environments in Bangladesh, Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines, Compuchia, Vietnam, Australia etc. In the tropical waters of the summer, the semi-tropical and semi-tropical countries of the Pacific are found.
Freshwater prawn is called prawn. World of lobster known as "Giant Fresh Water Prawn" The lobsters are invertebrates, cold-blooded, nostrilous celestial animals in the shell. Physical increase through felling changes. Consuming organic food, animal, plantation (Diatom, Copepod, Crustacea) etc., as food. In the absence of larvae or reno, they take plant and animal feed under the plankton banquet and juvenile or juvenile, which are relatively larger than the female pelvis and are fast growing, which are the homogeneous bhagis. Drop it.

	<h3>Advantages of lobster cultivation:</h3>
	<p><ul><li>Lobster growing rapidly.</li>
           <li>Tasty, uncut, easy to cook.</li>
           <li>It can be cultivated in fresh water and in low saline water (less than 5 ppm of salinity).</li>
           <li>There is a scope for cultivation everywhere in Bangladesh.</li>
           <li>Single and mixed cultivation (with carp national fish, rui, katla, mrigel) can be done.</li>
           <li>Reno Pona or PL produced in natural sources and hatcheries is available.</li>
           <li>It is possible to use supplementary food as an all-natural animal.</li>
           <li>The supplementary feeding material can be easily collected.</li>
           <li>Market prices, demand more and easier to sell.</li>

		<h3>Methods Of farming Shrimp</h3>
		
		<p>In our country, lobsters usually cultivate in two ways.
        </p>
		<h5>Single farming method</h5>
		<p>
		Only lobster cultivation is a single farming. In the single farming process, 6000-10000 pellets of rice pona are stored in every acre. The production is 400-500 kg per acre.
		</p>
		<h5>Mixed farming methods</h5>
		<p>Roti, Katla, Mrigal fishes are cultivated with lobster shrimp. In mixed cultivation method, 2000 -4000 lime sprigs per acre and stockpile of 2000-5000 carp national fish are stored. Production of shrimp 200-300 kg per acre and carp national fish is 2000-2500 kg.
In our country, it is possible to increase manifold production by making lobster cultivation in a modern way. The production of lobster shrimp in different countries of the world is 1200 to 2500 kg per acre. In our country, modern farming of lobster shrimp has not been widely introduced except for a few farmers. For modern cultivation it is essential to have a nursery pond with a pond in the pond.
<br>
Golda2 Nursing pond area is good for 20% of pond pond. 100% of acre pond is good. If 100 acres of one acre of pond pond, the size of the nursery pond will be 20 centuries. The nursery pond should be tight, sturdy, firmly repaired. The water level of the pond should be 4-5 feet and the floor should be flat. The top portion of the pond should be surrounded by net. The intent of enclosing the net is that the snakes, frogs, crabs, crickets, and the inside of the nursery pond can not be eaten by the rainforest. Besides, the ropes or ribbons are dragged over the pond so that the birds can not enter the pond. This increases the survival rate of Reno Pona and protects against bacterial attacks. This prevention is called biological safety or biological security or bio-security.</p>

		<h3>Nurseries and farming ponds ready:</h3>
		<p> According to the rules of the nurseries and pond pond, dried pineapple and dried with irrigation are necessary to apply lime and fertilizers to the soil. Then the thick leaks are inserted into the net. Water depth: The water depth in the nursery pond is 1.295 meters and the water depth of the pond is 1.5-1.8 meters. Lobster indigenous During the fall of the fall, tree branches, bamboo pots, PVC pipes and various types of materials are used for safe shelter. Male lobster is bigger than the size of the feet and attacks other shrubs with a response or a pinch of damage. After every fifteen days, the feet of the shrimps and grenades have to be broken. As a result of breaking the legs, other shrimp is protected from being eaten or eaten and the shrimp increase is high. 15-20% energy expenditure is required to move the foot.</p>
		<h3>Livestock disease pests:</h3>
		<p>If there is a lax pond environment, then there is no disease. Shrimp dies due to poisonous gas due to environmental degradation. Apart from this, there is antenna cut / broken, trail rash, siege on the body, accumulation of water in the mata, and worms on the head. If these diseases are treated properly, shrimp becomes cured.</p>
		


<h3>Production of lobster shrimp</h3>
<p>
Currently, 200-300 kg per acre in the production of lobster shrimp. Farmers produce lobster and fish, earning Rs. 2,00,000-250,000 per acre. In modern method, litter profusion of 1000-100 kg of prawn and 750-1000 kg of fish can be produced per acre. 380-400 taka is spent on the production of every lorry lobster. Modern farming of lobsters can be easily earned at Tk 4,50,000-5,000,000 per acre. There is a scope for cultivation of lobster everywhere in Bangladesh.</p>
