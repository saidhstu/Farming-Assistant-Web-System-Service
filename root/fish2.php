	Pangas fish is known as the source of chemical for the people of the country since the time of the year. This fish is found in natural free water bodies, especially in the country's coastal areas including the rivers of the country. At one time the Pangas fish were considered as high-fishes as a symbol of nobility. Now the navigability of rivers due to environmental change is decreasing day by day. Along with its natural breeding grounds, Pangas fish production is also gradually decreasing. But there is a huge potential for pond farming in Pond since the 1980s.

	<h3>Various varieties of Pangas fish</h3>
	<p>Among the species of Pangas, native Pangas and Thai Pangas are the most popular. Let's now know some information about their identity,
	<br>
<h5>Domestic Pangas:</h5> The country's pangas are dark brown in the back of the silver-colored backs and on the side line. There is no fiber in this fish. Still, our native species of Pangas is delicious and at a higher price. This fish is found in Padma, Meghna, Bahmiputra and Jamuna rivers of Bangladesh. They may survive in adverse environments. For the months of March to June, its fona is found in the main rivers, including the various rivers of the southern region of the country.

In the first place in our country, it was possible to successfully breed fishes in foreign countries in 1993. Today, Thai Pangas is a popular name for commercial cultivation. This species has increased rapidly than the native Pangas. This fish is up to 10-12 kg.</p>
		<h3>Pangas fish farming method</h3>
		
		<p>The method of fish farming depends on the characteristics of ponds or water bodies, environmental conditions, water control management, capital, quality fodder and market management. Keeping these factors in mind, it is important to decide how the cultivation process will be. Today we will know about single farming of pangas or intensive cultivation.

		<h3>Pond selection:</h3>
		<p>
		<ul><li>It is good to rectangle the pond farming pond. The floor of the pond should be well flattened. The depth of the pond should be kept from 1.5 to 2 meters.</li>
         <li>Looping soil pond is best for pigeon cultivation. It is necessary to keep a deep and shallow tube well in front of the pond so that it is necessary for quick water for emergency needs.</li><li>
       In the rainy season or excess rain so that the pond does not break, it is necessary to repair the necessary repair beforehand.

		<h3>Preparation of the pond</h3>
		<p>The next task of selecting the pond is to prepare the pond well. Now let's know some important information about pond preparation.
If there are aquatic weeds in different types and characteristics of the pond, then they will have to be removed first.
<ul><li>
 In the Pangas cultivation pond, unnecessary and gourmet fish such as Shol, Boal, Gajar, Taki, Baiam, Molla, Rump etc. should be removed before  Pangas cultivation. They can be removed in a variety of ways. These include-
 </li>
 <li>All unwanted fish should be removed by dragging the thick leaks repeatedly;</li>
  <li>Clean the pond water and make it possible to plow the ground with plow;
Sometimes, using different methods, it is not possible to completely destroy unnecessary and greedy fish. According to the advice of the local fish office, they can be suppressed using various medicines.</li><li>
Applying the lime to make the pond suitable for fish farming and sustainable is very important. For every hectare, 250 to 300 kg of lime is applied, in all ponds where there is no problem in water. If the lime is diluted by applying the lime before its application, its effectiveness multiplied.</li><li>
Both organic and chemical fertilizers are used to increase the natural food production of the pond. Generally, fertilizers have to be applied 4/5 days after application of lime. New pond and sandy soil pond should be applied more than organic fertilizers. However, the rate of chemical fertilizer application in the old pond pond is high. During pond preparation, use of 8 to 10 kg of dung or 4 to 5 kg chicken shit per century as organic fertilizer. In order to increase the efficiency of fertilizer, it is necessary to use 100 grams of TSP with organic fertilizers for 8 to 10 hours per year. Before using, add 100 grams of urea to every pond and sprinkle the mixture in every pond. If the color of pond water is green or brown, after 4 to 5 days of fertilizer application, it is usually suitable for pona reserves.</li></ul></p>
		
		<h3>Pona Collection and Transportation</h3>
		<p> When the pond preparation ends, it is necessary to collect the high quality Pangas fish. For this, the pona should be collected from a trusted hatchery. During Pona transportation, special caution should be taken so that there is no harm to the pond during transport. Before transport, the pond should be sustainable for 4 to 5 hours after foliage. Pona should not be excited at the time of transport.</p>
		<h3>Supply Foods</h3>
		<p>The natural food that pond is cultivated in Pangas is not enough for the expected yield of fish. Therefore, the implementation of balanced food must be ensured. It is to be remembered that the production of Pangas will be interrupted if the food supply does not supply the required quantity of food daily. The amount of fish feed depends on the age of the fish and body weight. After 15 days, after sampling some fish's weight will be tested to see if the fish is growing properly. It is best to provide 6 to 8 places in accordance with fixed quantity of pond. Grainy food preparation and supplements are needed to be supplied at specific places in the form of ball. By not sharing the food two or three times in equal proportion, the effectiveness of the diet increases a lot. Besides, it is also necessary to apply lime and fertilizer as needed
		<br>

<h3>Fish Collection</h3>
Based on the demand of the market, when the mean weight of Pangas is 500 to 600 grams, after the 5-6 months of fish stock, 50% of the stocked fish have to be sold in the market. This allows the remaining fish to grow rapidly.
